# William's Neovim config
## Setup
This config uses Mason for some of the language server and debug adapter setup, its menu can be opened with `:Mason`.

`:Lazy` will open up a GUI for some of the neovim plugins.

If a file doesn't have syntax highlighting use `:TSInstall <language>`.

Please ensure that your terminal config (`.bashrc`/`.zshrc`) has the appropriate variables exported, for example:
- `export JDTLS_HOME=/home/wbence/sdk/Java/jdtls-1.38.0/`
